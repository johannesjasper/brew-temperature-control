Simple temperature control for arduino
![](fritzing/sketch.png)

## Work in Progress
- [x] add display (8 digit 7-segment display with MAX7219) to sketch
- [ ] combine code snippets into one programm that
    - [ ] continuously displays the current temperature 
    - [ ] switches the heating element on and off according to a target temperature
    - [ ] use some propper algorithm in order to avoid oscilation
